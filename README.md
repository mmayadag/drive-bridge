## Introduction

Sync Engine is a vault syncing plugin to **synchronize vault files in multiple devices**, it supports:

**Backends**: [S3](https://sync.consensia.cc/deep-dive/modules/s3), [WebDAV](https://sync.consensia.cc/deep-dive/modules/webdav), [Google Drive](https://sync.consensia.cc/deep-dive/modules/gdrive)<br>
**Features**:

- [Client-side encryption](https://sync.consensia.cc/deep-dive/modules/encryption)
- Bidirectional / mirror remote / mirror local syncing.
- Startup / periodic / save-on-change syncing.
- Conflict resolution strategies ([smart merge](https://sync.consensia.cc/deep-dive/modules/smart-merge) / keep both / latest survive / keep remote / keep local / skip).
- Rate / memory control options.
- Custom headers.

Sync Engine is also **a modular platform** that everyone can build upon. You can achieve customized experience by [building your own modules via the convenient SDK](https://sync.consensia.cc/development/develop-a-module), extending the plugin, [contributing to the community](ttps://sync.consensia.cc/usage/contributing), all without modifying the source code.

Access Sync Engine documentation at [`sync.consensia.cc`](https://sync.consensia.cc), which contains usage guides, existing modules, permission claims, benchmarking, and documentation on how to build a module.

There's already a lot of plugins to sync your notes between devices:

- [Remotely Save](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save) supports many backends (S3, Dropbox, OneDrive, WebDAV). But is optionally paid, development paused for years with stability issues
- [Self-hosted LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) and [Fast Note Sync](https://github.com/haierkeys/obsidian-fast-note-sync) offer real-time, server-based sync. They work well if you are comfortable setting up your own server.
- [Relay](https://github.com/No-Instructions/Relay) is a managed relay service. Convenient, but your notes pass through infrastructure you don't control.

Sync Engine fits the gap: you want to choose your own storage, you want the plugin to stay small because unused features aren't bundled in, and you want a highly optimized syncing that is no slower than a self-hosted server.

## Our Claims

### Fast

- Incremental syncing never uploads the full vault each time.
- [Anchored Asymmetric Storage](https://sync.consensia.cc/deep-dive/asymmetric-storage) substantially accelerates syncing.
- Real-time sync uses cached remote states, allowing it to complete within milliseconds.
- [Benchmarking shows around **100x** faster than Remotely Save in some metrics](https://sync.consensia.cc/usage/benchmark).
- Handles vaults with thousands of files smoothly.
- No slower than a self-hosted server
- Detailed performance comparison can be found in [performance benchmark](https://sync.consensia.cc/usage/benchmark).

### Free and Reliable

- The plugin is completely open-source, free to use and distribute ([MIT License](https://mit-license.org/))
- All source code, including plugin core, all modules, and the documentation website are publicly accessible in this repo; and thus they are all scanned by Obsidian's automated scan. There's no hidden telemetry or third-party server.
- The [documentation](https://sync.consensia.cc) documents everything in detail, including [permission](https://sync.consensia.cc/usage/permissions) and [security](https://sync.consensia.cc/usage/security) claims.
- The plugin protects you from attacks: [encryption](https://sync.consensia.cc/deep-dive/modules/encryption), [module verification](https://sync.consensia.cc/deep-dive/extensibility).
- The [sync algorithm](https://sync.consensia.cc/deep-dive/sync) is battle-tested and has evolved over thousands of usage.

### Extensible

- You can add backends, optimizers, sync triggers, i18n resources, decision strategies, conflict strategies, setting entries, custom file processing, and invoke all possible operations in custom modules.
- Documentation and SDK with debug and testing toolkit are provided.
- Plugin provides dedicated module discovery and management UI.
- Repo accepts any module contribution as long as it respects [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Usage

1. Download and enable `Sync Engine` from Obsidian plugin store.
2. Open "Module management" setting, install needed translations, backends and optional features.
3. Fill the necessary information about your cloud service in the settings interface.
4. Start your first sync from command palette or ribbon button.
5. Review the sync tasks that will be performed.
6. Click "Confirm", and your files will arrive the configured backend at the speed of light.
7. Access [documentation](https://sync.consensia.cc) for advanced usages.

## Roadmap

Below is a list of planned features and improvements, the faster this plugin is adopted and the **star** ⭐ grows, the faster the development will be. Also, we welcome contributors that would like to help us with the development of either modules or core.

- [x] v3.0: Rewrite entirely, dynamic module loading, module store, asymmetric storage, and rebrand
- [x] v3.1: Migrate settings to Obsidian v1.13 API
- [ ] v3.2: Granular sync strategy selection / exclusion inclusion rule refactor based on ordered glob match rules.

Sync Engine has a [wishlist of features](https://github.com/hesprs/sync-engine/issues/214), you can react with **thumbs up** 👍 on feature comments you would like to have. And the features with more votes will have higher priority.

## Common Questions

<details><summary>What should I do if I get an error during syncing?</summary>

You can simply retry the sync. An error does not block later syncs nor corrupt your files.

If the error persists after retrying, please [open an issue](https://github.com/hesprs/sync-engine/issues/new), describing the error, your setup, with the log attached.

</details>

<details><summary>How should I manage my remote storage when using this plugin?</summary>

According to this plugin's [file handling strategy](https://hesprs.github.io/projects/sync-engine#technical-breakdown), all remote changes will be propagated to all vaults. So it's generally not recommended to manually manage your remote storage unless you intend to add / remove these files. Manual management is more discouraged when you have encryption or asymmetric storage enabled.

</details>

<details><summary>Why is Module management empty / loading forever?</summary>

If you installed Sync Engine but its "Module management" option shows no available modules / is always loading. Please check the following:

1. Are Obsidian and Sync Engine updated to the latest available versions? You can find the latest version of obsidian [here](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/releases) and Sync Engine's version in the GitHub repository.
2. If you can ensure Obsidian and Sync Engine have been updated to the latest version. Please try to access `https://sync.consensia.cc` in your browser; if you cannot, please go to Sync Engine's settings in Obsidian, find Development → Module sources, clear existing sources and add source `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hesprs/sync-engine/refs/heads/gh-pages/modules-alternative.json`; then see whether the modules can load now.
3. If there's still no modules shown, please test by varying your network setup. E.g. home WiFi, mobile network, with / without proxy.
4. If none of the steps above can help you, please open a new issue in Sync Engine GitHub repository with the symptom and troubleshooting you've already tried.
