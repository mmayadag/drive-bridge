## Obsidian WebDAV Sync v2.1.0 - 2026-04-08

### Sync planning and execution

- Corrected a misleading execution error message in AddRecordTask.
- Refined mergeability checks so base text is only computed when needed.

## Obsidian WebDAV Sync v2.0.0 - 2026-04-05

### Huge Internal Refactor

**Many breaking changes are present although auto migration is provided. Strongly recommended to backup before upgrade.**

- Complete rewrite and simplification of storage layer to separated IndexedDB-backed stores for base text and sync records. Drastically reduced storage read / write overhead.
- Added safer key parsing and bulk `getItems/removeItems` helpers in storage to reduce round-trips.
